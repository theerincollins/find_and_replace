Find and Replace

User inputs three text strings. The first text string will be the receiver.
 The other two text string will be arguments in a ruby method.

 Do second: Add to your method, so that your method takes into account partial matches.
  For example "I am walking my cat to the cathedral".find_and_replace("cat", "dog") would
  return the silly phrase "I am walking my dog to the doghedral."
